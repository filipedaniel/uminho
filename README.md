# UMinho


So, I got a university degree :mortar_board:, at [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN/).

I used git for pretty much all of the course, but in a different platforms like GitHub, BitBucket or GitLab. 

Now, I decided to put some projects together.

Remember that all of the code here is student code, so not the best thing you will see (n00bs learning!).

If you're a Software Engineering student, the projects will *probably* help you, especially because every now and then the teachers hand over simalar projects.
